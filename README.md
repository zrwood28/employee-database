# sql-challenge
Modeling, engineering, and analysis of past employee data using PostgreSQL.

## Summary
Using the QuickDBD tool, tables were created and organized to be imported into PostgreSQL. These tables were based on CSV files that contained a variety of employee data. Once the tables were created, all data was imported to populate each table. All code for this process is seen in the table schemata file. Analysis work involved a series of queries that provided access to employee information dependent on specific sets of parameters. Some of these included sorting employees and managers seperately, organizing by name, and viewing employees from specific departments. Each query is present in the respective sql file. Additionally, an image of the ERD is in the reposotory and all CSVs are contained within the Resources file.
